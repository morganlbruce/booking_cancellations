# Requirements

- Python 3.10.12
- pip 22.0.2

(This may work fine with different versions, but those are what I used)

# Set-up
To run the notebook, execute the following in your terminal:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

Once the virtual environment is already set up, run the following:

```
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab
```
